The released date was April 3, 2006, the anime is about a group of teenage girls attending three affiliated all-girl schools on Astraea Hill. A common theme throughout the stories is the intimate lesbian relationships between the characters.\r\n\r\nThe story is about a young girl named Nagisa Aoi entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory."", ""Two of the best Yuri animes out there. If you liked one, you'll love the other. Bloom Into You has a more realistic story / is, at least in my personal opinion, better done, but Strawberry Panic is a classic and we all love Shizuma ;)"", ""What even is a Beastar? What gardening club could exist with only one member? Are there really schools like that? OMG, furries!\r\n\r\nBeastars is truly something new, but, it does have inspirations, and there are a few things about it that really only make sense as a faithful adaptation of another work. (E.g., why in the world would someone as powerful in society at the Beastar be solely chosen from among high school children?)\r\n\r\nI think one of those inspirations is a mildly-infamous 2006 yuri show called Strawberry Panic. The two works share many elements:\r\n\r\n• The elite boarding school setting.\r\n• The fruit-themed institution names (Cherryton Academy and Strawberry Hill)\r\n• The strong female love interest tending to a spacious garden alone\r\n• Instant romantic attraction bordering on something creepy or supernatural\r\n• French-language elements throughout (Beastars: the opening song and characters named after French kings; Strawberry Panic: practically everything)\r\n• The occupants of the different residence houses being at each other's throats (although Beastars' more-literal premise makes better sense.)\r\n• The selection of a star among the students to unite the houses.\r\n• The title of the star (“Beastar”, a portmanteau of “beast” & “star”, and “Étoile”, French for “star”)\r\n• The late, shocking reveal of the true intended composition of the star role (literally the exact same plan but for different reasons)*\r\n• An in-depth exploration of the extreme toll it takes on the star when that intention falls apart*\r\n• An edgy-for-the-time wholehearted embrace of a social taboo which tricks some reviewers into thinking that the work is “about” yuri or furry or whatever, but in hindsight is just about human relationships.\r\n\r\n(*Later in the Beastars manga. The anime isn't there yet.)\r\n\r\nA caveat: these two works are not at all similar in tone or plot. Whatever Paru Itagaki's inspirations are (and I have no hard proof that this actually is one of them) she transcends all of them.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick one thing to watch it would definitely be Beastars, but Strawberry Panic is pretty good as a bit of over-the-top earnest boarding school yuri, and it's interesting to imagine how a writer can take the dry bones of another story and turn it into something completely new.""]","[1, 1, 1]"

The MC, Tanikaze grows to a liking with the Chimera which has human awareness; they are basically a power duo on the battlefield when attacking hostile Gauna (alien species) This is the biggest similarity between both series, they're essentially compatible characters with Zero Two and Hiro, we know from the series Darling in the Franxx that Zero Two is technically not human and thus seems like a direct mirror to the Chimera Tsugumi. \r\n\r\nSecondly, in Darling in the Franxx, there is a control hierarchy or connection between the youth characters and higher in command known as adults, papas or mamas. In Knights of Sidonia S2, there is a similar chain of command called the council, which is essentially much older and wiser humans that have undergone a surgery that allows them to live near immortal lives and maintain their physical youth features. In both series, these higher in command control what is the best option for their survival as well as the society that live under them and as such, they decide many important decisions aboard their ships/ in their domes. \r\n\r\nThirdly, They both are set in a post apocalyptic settings; Darling in the Franxx is set on a planet (which may or may not be Earth) whereas Knights of Sidonia S2 is set on a large meteorite in Space. Although they seem to occur in drastic settings, both societies live within a man made shelter from the outside world in order to protect and preserve humanity. \r\n\r\nLastly, in both series they tend to have a common enemy: In Darling in the Franxx, the enemy that feeds on humanity and leads in destruction is a land monster known as Klaxosaur whereas similarly, in Knights of Sidonia S2 the monsters that are a menace to mankind are known as Gauna. In Darling in the Franxx, Zero Two, the female MC has a portion of Klaxosaur DNA and part human (I'd assume considering she maintains a human figure); Similarly to Darling in the Franx, Knights of Sidonia's main Mecha/female characters is a mix of Gauna DNA and human which is why she is referred to as a chimera in the series. \r\n\r\nAfter watching a bit of Knights of Sidonia, it becomes much more apparent that there is much more similar chemistry shared with Darling in the Franxx. I assume that is because the general premise is intriguing/entertaining to watch; I enjoy both series so it's no surprise that I'm submitting this recommendation for both. \r\nThanks for reading!""]",[1]
